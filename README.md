## Tutorials

I will not explain why I am doing things in them. The assumption is people know the theory and just want to get the library working. I haven't obviously performed this exhaustively, but it should work for the configs I have discussed in each, below.

1. Installation [[File]](./tutorials/Installation.md)
2. Simple set up to run instance segmentation [[File]](./tutorials/)

## Solutions: 

1. https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/issues/10378 [[SOLVE]](./solves/1.py)

# Important todo's

- [ ] Extensive guide on foolproof installation. [Help Needed!]

## Contributions

Working on an exhaustive guide. But PRs and Issues are always welcome!
